## **Context & Task State Management**

Support for robust, agent-like workflows in intent-kit depends on introducing a first-class, extensible `Context` entity.
This section tracks requirements and implementation progress for context-driven agent task state:

### **Context Entity & Task State Management**

* [x] **Simple Context Object**
  Implement a minimal, idiomatic `IntentContext` (user/session ID, params, results, metadata, history).

* [x] **Context Package Structure**
  Move context entity to its own subpackage (`context/`), enable multiple context types.

* [x] **Context Pass-through & Mutation**
  Ensure context is passed to all intent trees, handlers, splitters, and can be mutated at every step.

* [x] **Multi-Turn/Session Context Support**
  Add support for persistent context objects spanning multiple user turns/workflows (not just single input).

* [x] **Per-Field (Fine-Grained) Locking**
  Implement per-field lockable dicts for concurrent, safe mutation during parallel/async intent execution.

* [x] **Context Dependency Declarations**
  Require intents to declare context fields they read/write (`inputs`, `outputs`) for dependency graph building.

* [x] **Task State & History Logging**
  Log all steps, mutations, and outcomes in context history for replay/audit.

* [ ] **Context Debug/Trace API**
  Expose APIs/utilities for inspecting context evolution and intent/task state transitions.

* [ ] **Type-Safe Context Extensions**
  Allow domain-specific extensions and type-safe fields for custom workflows.

> **Implementation Notes:**
> - âœ… **IntentContext Class**: Thread-safe context with field-level locking, complete audit trail, and session isolation
> - âœ… **Context Dependencies**: Declarative system for specifying what fields intents read/write
> - âœ… **Backward Compatibility**: Existing handlers work without modification, context is optional
> - âœ… **Context as Final Parameter**: All handlers receive context as the final parameter for consistency
> - âœ… **Enhanced IntentNode**: Supports context_inputs and context_outputs declarations
> - âœ… **Updated IntentGraph**: Passes context through all execution paths with fallback support
> - âœ… **Demo Implementation**: Complete working example in `examples/context_demo.py`
> - âœ… **Splitter Integration**: Basic support added, needs testing with context-aware splitters
> - ðŸ”„ **Advanced Features**: Debug API and type-safe extensions planned for future iterations

> **Note:**
> intent-kit's agent/task state is always explicit and auditableâ€”never emergent.
> All task context, dependencies, and results must be statically declared and analyzable.
