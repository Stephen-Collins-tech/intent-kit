# Instructions: Using the Project Tasks Structure

This directory (`tasks/`) is the central hub for all project management, engineering planning, and roadmap documentation for Intent Kit.

## How to Use This Structure

- **Add new roadmap, checklist, or planning files** to the `tasks/` directory as the project grows.
- **Use `tasks/TASKS.md` as the main index and entry point** for all engineering and planning documentation.
- **Each sub-file is now focused**, making it easier to maintain and expand your project management documentation.

## Best Practices
- Keep each file focused on a single area (e.g., API roadmap, engine features, testing, documentation, completed tasks).
- Add new files for meeting notes, retrospectives, release checklists, or engineering guides as needed.
- Update the table of contents in `tasks/TASKS.md` to reflect new files or major changes.
- Use this structure to keep project planning organized, transparent, and easy to navigate for all contributors.
