## Sub-files & Future Organization

As the project grows, add more files to the `tasks/` directory for:
- `feature-roadmap.md` — High-level feature planning
- `release-checklists.md` — Release and QA checklists
- `meeting-notes/` — Directory for meeting notes and decisions
- `engineering-guides/` — Engineering process, onboarding, etc.
- `retrospectives.md` — Sprint or milestone retrospectives

Keep this file as the main entry point and index for all project management and planning docs.
