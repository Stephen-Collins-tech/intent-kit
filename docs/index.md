# Intent-Kit

Welcome to **Intent-Kit**, an open-source Python library for building hierarchical intent-classification and execution systems that can work with any AI backend – or with none at all.

This documentation site is generated with [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and is fully open-source.  You can contribute fixes and improvements by submitting pull-requests to the main repository.

## Why Intent-Kit?

* **Tree-based architecture**  – Compose deterministic, inspectable workflows.
* **Zero core dependencies** – Adds AI only when _you_ need it.
* **Rich developer experience** – Typed handlers, context tracking, interactive visualisation.
* **Pluggable intelligence** – Keyword, Regex, Fuzzy, LLM, and custom classifiers.
